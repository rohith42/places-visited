# Places I've Visited

Python script to read data files and output a HTML map that visually displays all the places and states
around the world that I've visited.

Map is made using Folium and GeoJSON data found in the json folder. Used pandas to read the data found
in the data folder.

To make changes to the map: edit the corresponding data files with the changes you want to make, then
run Map.py to update Map.html
